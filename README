= Messages =

keyboard/Key: an uint16 value corresponding to the ncurses keycode.

= Usage =

After suscribing, the keycode can be processed by checking for std::isprint(c) (cctype header) for a printable character.
If so, the key value corresponds to the ascii code of the character. Otherwise, the character will be one of the KEY_* constants of
ncurses library header. These special values are numbers between KEY_MIN and KEY_MAX.
